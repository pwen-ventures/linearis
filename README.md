# Linearis

CLI tool for [Linear.app](https://linear.app) optimized for AI agents. JSON output, smart ID resolution, token-efficient usage commands, and a discover-then-act workflow that keeps agent context small. Works just as well for humans who prefer structured data on the command line.

## Why?

The official Linear MCP works fine, but it eats up ~13k tokens just by being connected -- before the agent does anything. Linearis takes a different approach: instead of exposing the full API surface upfront, agents discover what they need through a two-tier usage system. `linearis usage` gives an overview in ~200 tokens, then `linearis <domain> usage` provides the full reference for one area in ~300-500 tokens. A typical agent interaction costs ~500-700 tokens of context, not ~13k.

The trade-off is coverage. An MCP exposes the entire Linear API; Linearis covers the operations that matter for day-to-day work with issues, comments, cycles, documents, and files. If you need to manage custom workflows, integrations, or workspace settings, the MCP is the better choice.

**This project scratches my own itches,** and satisfies my own usage patterns of working with Linear: I **do** work with tickets/issues and comments on the command line; I **do not** manage projects or workspaces etc. there. YMMV.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g linearis
```

Requires Node.js >= 22.

## Authentication

```bash
linearis auth login
```

This opens Linear in your browser, guides you through creating an API key, and stores the token encrypted in `~/.linearis/token`.

Alternatively, provide a token directly:

```bash
# Via CLI flag
linearis --api-token <token> issues list

# Via environment variable
LINEAR_API_TOKEN=<token> linearis issues list
```

Token resolution order: `--api-token` flag > `LINEAR_API_TOKEN` env > `~/.linearis/token` > `~/.linear_api_token` (deprecated).

### OAuth Actor Authorization (optional)

When using an OAuth token authorized with `actor=app`, you can attribute created issues/comments to a named user with a custom avatar (rendered as _User (via Application)_ in Linear) by setting:

- `LINEAR_CREATE_AS_USER` — display name for the acting user
- `LINEAR_DISPLAY_ICON_URL` — URL of the avatar image

These are applied automatically to `issues create`, `comments create`, and `comments reply`. They have no effect with a personal API token. Explicit input values in the mutation override the env defaults.

## Usage

All output is JSON. Pipe through `jq` or similar for formatting.

```bash
# Discovery
linearis usage                # overview of all domains
linearis issues usage         # detailed usage for one domain
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Discover available commands
linearis usage

# Drill into a domain
linearis issues usage

# List recent issues
linearis issues list --limit 10

# Search for issues
linearis issues search "authentication bug"

# Create an issue
linearis issues create "Fix login flow" --team Platform --priority 2

# Add a comment
linearis comments create ENG-42 --body "Investigating this now"
```

For the full reference of every command and flag, run:

```bash
linearis <domain> usage
```

## AI Agent Integration

### How agents use Linearis

The CLI is structured around a discover-then-act pattern that matches how agents work:

1. **Discover** -- `linearis usage` returns a compact overview of all domains (~200 tokens). The agent reads this once to understand what's available.
2. **Drill down** -- `linearis <domain> usage` gives the full command reference for one domain (~300-500 tokens). The agent only loads what it needs.
3. **Execute** -- All commands return structured JSON. No parsing of human-readable tables or prose.

This means the agent never loads the full API surface into context. It pays for what it uses, one domain at a time.

### Linearis vs. MCP

| | Linearis | Linear MCP |
|---|---|---|
| Context cost | ~500-700 tokens per interaction | ~13k tokens on connect |
| Coverage | Common operations (issues, comments, cycles, docs, files) | Full Linear API |
| Output | JSON via stdout | Tool call responses |
| Setup | `npm install -g linearis` + bash tool | MCP server connection |

Use Linearis when token efficiency matters and you work primarily with issues and related data. Use the MCP when you need full API coverage or tight tool-call integration.

### Example prompt

```markdown
## Linear (project management)

Tool: `linearis` CLI via Bash. All output is JSON.

Discovery: Run `linearis usage` once to see available domains. Run `linearis <domain> usage` for full command reference of a specific domain. Do NOT guess flags or subcommands -- check usage first.

Ticket format: "ABC-123". Always reference tickets by their identifier.

Workflow rules:
- When creating a ticket, ask the user which project to assign it to if unclear.
- For subtasks, inherit the parent ticket's project by default.
- When a task in a ticket description changes status, update the description.
- For progress beyond simple checkbox changes, add a comment instead of editing the description.

File handling: `issues read` returns an `embeds` array with signed download URLs and expiration timestamps. Use `files download` to retrieve them. Use `files upload` to attach new files, then reference the returned URL in comments or descriptions.
```

Add this (or a version adapted to your workflow) to your `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` so every agent session has it in context automatically.
