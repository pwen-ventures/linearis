---

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Resolve/unresolve comment threads** — `linearis comments resolve <comment-uuid>` (with optional `--resolving-comment <uuid>`) and `linearis comments unresolve <comment-uuid>` wrap the Linear `commentResolve` / `commentUnresolve` mutations. Only top-level (thread root) comment UUIDs are accepted. The `CommentFields` fragment now also returns `resolvedAt`, `resolvingUser`, and `resolvingComment` on every comment-shaped response.

## [2026.4.1] - 2026-04-07

[2026.4.1]: https://github.com/linearis-oss/linearis/compare/v2025.12.3...v2026.4.1

### Breaking Changes

- **Complete architecture rewrite** to a strict five-layer architecture: CLI Input → Command → Resolver → Service → JSON Output. [#45](https://github.com/linearis-oss/linearis/issues/45), [#27](https://github.com/linearis-oss/linearis/issues/27), [#43](https://github.com/linearis-oss/linearis/issues/43), [#47](https://github.com/linearis-oss/linearis/issues/47), [PR#49](https://github.com/linearis-oss/linearis/pull/49)
- **`embeds` commands renamed to `files`** — `embeds download` → `files download`, `embeds upload` → `files upload`
- **`project-milestones` commands renamed to `milestones`**
- **`search` subcommands merged into `list`** — use `issues list --status ...` instead of `issues search --status ...`

### Added

- **Encrypted token authentication** — `linearis auth login` opens Linear in the browser and stores the token encrypted in `~/.linearis/token`. New subcommands: `auth login`, `auth status`, `auth logout`
- **Issue relation flags** — `--blocks`, `--blocked-by`, `--relates-to` on issue update
- **Cursor pagination** — `--after` and `--limit` flags on all list commands
- **Assignee resolution** — `--assignee` flag resolves by name or email
- **`usage` subcommand** on every command group for self-documenting CLI help
- **Request timeouts** — GraphQL API requests time out after 30 seconds, file download/upload after 60 seconds. Prevents indefinite hangs, especially important for LLM agent tool timeouts
- **GraphQL Code Generator pipeline** — queries and mutations defined in `.graphql` files under `graphql/`, codegen produces typed DocumentNodes
- **Biome** for formatting and linting (replaces previous setup)
- **Lefthook** git hooks with **commitlint** for conventional commit enforcement
- **Security policy** (`SECURITY.md`) with responsible disclosure process
- **GitHub community templates** — bug report form, feature request form, PR template

### Fixed

- File download and upload commands now use proper error exit codes (exit 1) on failure instead of returning exit code 0 with a success envelope

### Documentation

- Complete documentation rewrite for v2 architecture
- New docs: `architecture.md`, `development.md`, `testing.md`, `build-system.md` with layer invariants, mock patterns, and service/resolver/command templates
- `AGENTS.md` restructured for machine-first readability with decision trees and anti-patterns
- `README.md` rewritten for current CLI commands and agent optimization
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` expanded with dev setup, testing, and architecture pointer
- Removed obsolete 26k-line GraphQL schema dump and completed implementation plans

### Breaking Changes

- **Issue "status" flag renamed**: `--state`/`--states` options renamed to `--status` for consistency with Linear's UI terminology. Thanks for the (appreciated but ultimately unused) PR, [@ralfschimmel](https://github.com/ralfschimmel)! <!-- ZCO-1641 -->
  - `issues search --states` → `--status` (still accepts comma-separated values)
  - `issues update --state` → `--status` (short flag `-s` unchanged)

### Tooling

- Prepublish validation to ensure `dist/main.js` exists and is executable before publishing to npm <!-- ZCO-1604 -->
